Hello! My name is James Cole.

This repository contains a collection of small projects that I have created. They are meant to serve as snapshot of my progression of knowledge. I hope that you find them fun and perhaps helpful. I have not gone back and updated the projects. They represent the scope of my abilities when they were created.

The technologies I am currently learning are:
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* React JS
* Express.js
* Discord.js
* Mongoose
* MongoDB
* CSS
* HTML
* C++
* Python

The best way to contact me is through the Discord chat application. My username is dmc_run#4350
